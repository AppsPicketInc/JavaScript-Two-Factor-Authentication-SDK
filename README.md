AppsPicket I2FA© SDK

AppsPicket's I2FA© library for Web Applications is based on a patent-pending 
technology developed to strengthen the user authentication process. By incorporating I2FA 
in your Web App, you can ensure that both the user password and the user device are checked 
each time the user logs into the App. 
Traditionally, it is done in a cumbersome manner using OTPs or Authenticator Apps. 
Thus, you can ensure two-factor authentication of your user without troubling the user.
